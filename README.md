Example of use
--------------

```
// class
class SampleDataView extends AbstractDataView {

    public function serialize( $data, $options )
    {
        $this->add( 'property.path', $data, 'name_of_key', $options );
        $this->addSet( 'property.path', $data->getSomeArray(), 'name_of_array_key', $options );
        $this->addFixed( 'fixed_value_name', count( $data->getSomeArray() );
    }
}

// use
$view = new SampleDataView;
$view->serialize( $someEntity );
$data = $view->getData();

// $data is now something like:
// array( 'name_of_key' => 'value_of_$entity->getProperty()->getPath()', 'name_of_array_key' => array( 1, 2, 3, 'etc' ), 'fixed_value_name' => 4 );

```
Introduction
--------------

To get a better idea of what a DataView looks like, check out the various Samples in the DataView folder.

The DataView bundle is a configuration handler that works together with the serialization tool of your choice to
serialize various entities and arrays. ItÂ´s an ideal tool when you need to communicate a lot of entity data to your
frontend.

I personally recommend JMS/Serializer, but any should work.

How to use
----------

- First, create a new class and make it extend AbstractDataView
- Implement a serialize() method to determine properties to serialize
- Use ->add and ->addSet to pick properties and arrays of properties that you want added
- Use $options to get some more control over which properties need to be included
- Use getData() to get a data map, then run that through your serializer of choice

Nesting
-------

DataViews can be nested. Instead of a propertyName, you can add a new DataView().
All the contents of the nested dataview will be added to a single element of the parent.
Nesting works with both add (which will add a single subview) and addSet (which will add an array of subviews)
$options can be passed to the subview as usual.
